    <h1>Endless Possibility</h1>
    <div id="cambio"> This is my escape
        I'm running through this world
        And I'm not looking back
        
        'Cause I know I can go
        Where no one's ever gone
        And I'm not looking back
    
       But how will I know when I get there?
       And how will I know when to leave?
       We've all gotta start from somewhere
       And it's right there for me
       The possibilities are never ending
       I see it, I see it, and now it's all within my reach
       (Endless possibility)
       I see it, I see it now, it's always been inside of me
       (And now I feel so free)
       Endless possibility </div>

    <h1>Sonic Heroes</h1>
    <div id="cambio2"> What comes up must come down
        Hear my feet don't touch the ground
        See the world spinning upside down
        A mighty trance without a sound!
        
        I can feel your every rage
        Step aside I'll turn the page,
        Breaking through your crazy maze,
        Like a lazer beam, my eyes on you!
        
        Watch me throw the night away,
        watch me save the day,
        Feel my strongest getin' close,
        Heading your waaaaay!
        
        SONIC HEROES!

    <h1>Open Your Heart</h1>
    <div id="cambio3"> Thunder, rain, and lightning
    Danger, water rising
    Clamour, sirens wailing
    It's such a bad sign

    Shadows of dark creatures
    Steel clouds floating in the air
    People run for shelter
    What's gonna happen to us!?

    All the steps we take, all the moves we make, all the pain at stake
    I see the chaos for everyone who are we what can we do
    You and i are same in the way that we have our own styles that we won't change
    Yours is filled with evil and mine's not there is no way i can lose</div>
